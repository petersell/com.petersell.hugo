____
A team should have a mission. Do they own a product? Can you describe in one sentence what this team does?
Too many people are stuck in Scope Farms. Their purpose is to build whatever is asked from them. No questions asked. Itâ€™s unproductive and a horrible waste of talent.
Every team has a purpose. This can be a project goal or the ownership of a product. It can be a small subset of a larger whole, but within those borders, they set the direction.

Without a mission, there is no team.
